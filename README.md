# Split and Merge
Tagged image file format (TIFF) images acquired from fluorescent microscopes often contain multi-dimensional and multi-channel data. It is often required to split or rearrange the dimensionality and channels containing fluorescent intensity data. Split and Merge is a Fiji/ImageJ macro that eases this process by allowing a single-file multidimensional TIFF stack to be split into separate files, or by merging together separate files into a single TIFF stack.

## Dependencies

This macro has been tested with the latest versions of Fiji/ImageJ.
